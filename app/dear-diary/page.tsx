        Dear Diary is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect or
        store any personal data on external servers. All data, including your
        name, PIN, and diary entries, is stored locally on your device using
        secure storage mechanisms. We do not use any analytics tools, tracking
        software, or third-party advertising services.

        You may optionally provide your name to personalize the app. You may set
        a PIN code for local app protection. This PIN is stored securely on your

        third party.
